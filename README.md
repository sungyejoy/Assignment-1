# FED Assignment 1 - S10255093G - Sung Yeji

This project is for my Interactive Development Assignment 1. I have created a website that is showcasing a rising K-pop Girl Group that I am a big fan of, NewJeans. This website is created by utilising HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The design of the website kept simple with just a home page, a page to introduce the members of the girl group, and lastly a page to purchase the merchandises.

## Design Process

NewJeans is known for their multiple, yet defined art style. The colour palette of NewJeans is mainly consists of a deep cool blue colour and white. Some art styles I have incoporated from their art style is utlizing Apple emojis. At the last section of the home page, there are two emojis (eye and a face) which are Apple emoji. I also have utlized their artstyle of powerpuff characters in the About page.

The design of the website is fairly simple as NewJeans is known for their simple and clean vibe, to enhance the mysterious vibe that lets fans wait for new updates. The company of NewJeans tend to not provide the fans with excessive/extra information to keep the fans interested and follow the girlgroup along their journey.

As a fan of NewJeans, I want to perform an action that allows new fans to find out more about the group, and hence I added a page to include introductions of each members. I also want to perform an action that allows fans to purchase their goods and merchandises easily.

As a company member of NewJeans, I want to perform an action that allows fans of NewJeans to purchase the goods of NewJeans to gain profit.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
